"Why hasnâ€™t anyone built a fully open source arXiv addressing some of its obvious limitations? ... E.g. anonymous submissions, reviews, conference management, fine-grained notifications. arxiv-sanity is great but only addresses 'discovery'"

- feed of papers recommended by selected people - @dwf: "The arXiv overlay I want: basically the old Google Reader social feed but for arXiv. Let me see what colleagues I choose recommend. ... Maybe grouped by topic/tag, so if a colleague has multiple interests I can pay attention to our intersection." https://twitter.com/dwf/status/874384188467761152
